Fixes several bugs in game files.

Modifies simulation - all players in multiplayer must have this mod.

Built for patch 1.45 (Eivonn's fine) , 2025-10-06+

NOTE: all below bugs have been fixed in 1.49.6 (diplomatic repercussions), they will be removed from the mod after it goes live.
If there are no fixes left, mod will be archived (might be brought back if I find more fixable issues).

# Fixes
- advent
  - radiance battleship / animosity : is now correctly reducing damage taken per psi power instead of increasing it
  - temple of purification : can now only be built once per planet
  - justicia dreadnought / reinvigorate / malefic locus : rank 2+ correctly increases allies' damage instead of decreasing it
- vasari
  - sularkon tyrant / subversion grid : incorrect values in tooltip
  - anarkrul wanderer / nano devourer plague : now ends if caster dies, no longer lasts forever
